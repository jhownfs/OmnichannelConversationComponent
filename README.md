Hey there, how are you?

This component was development to help when you have messaging session in waiting status and Omnichannel doesn't redirect to agent in online status, the Agent can see their messaging in waiting status and add for theyself.

## USE CASE

Sometimes our agents in Omnichannel became offline, it's normal behaviour, maybe unstable internet, but when it happen Messaging Session assigned to him/her, change status to "waiting" again, if this Messaing has that specific user to answer, they continue waiting for this user.

When this user became online again, sometimes Omnichannel or better PendingServiceRouting for this Messaging doesn't work and agent stay without it conversation and customer be without answer.

This component help with that, allow agent see they conversation in waiting and not assigned for him yet, allow they self-assign.
